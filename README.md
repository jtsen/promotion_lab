1. Run dtree_postprune_test.py to build decision tree.  
2. Run nb_test.py to build naive bayes.  

-pre_prune.jpg is the decision tree built with pre-pruning parameters.  
-post_prune.jpg is the decision tree after post-pruning.  
-store_data_numerical.csv is the data file for decision tree classifier.  
-store_data.csv is the data file for naive bayes classifier.
